Hi,

Here is an update for the package WorldMapR.

I have recently submitted another update of the same package, but it had a huge bug which
caused the whole package to not work properly.
This has been corrected in this version. I have also added some functionalities that I had prepared but planned to release later.

I have tested the package on:

- ubuntu-latest on GitHub, R-* (any version)
- macos-13 on GitHub, R-* (any version)
- macos-latest on GitHub, R-* (any version)
- windows-latest on GitHub, R-* (any version)
- Fedora Linux 38 (Container Image), R-devel (2024-11-24 r87369)
