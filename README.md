WorldMapR (v 1.0.1) is an R package for creating world heat maps, based on continuous or categorical variables.

The attached vignette provides further information about how to use this package.

WorldMapR is currently on CRAN - DOI:	10.32614/CRAN.package.WorldMapR

Future updates will address the following:

- improve documentation for EPSG coordinates
- improve vignette readability
- add possibility to obtain different EPSG to geometries_data() (now, only WGS84 is available)
